## Submission

### Task 1: original-guide.js

This program configures 3 LEDs to fade 1 by 1 and they cycle in a loop.

### Task 2: enable-matrix.js

This program enables both the external LEDs and the microbit's LED matrix at the same time. The Matrix plays a 3-frame animation repeatedly while the LEDs perform the same function as Part 1.

### Task 3: twenty-eight.js

This program enables both the external LEDs and the microbit's LED matrix at the same time. The Matrix plays a screensaver repeatedly while the LEDs perform the same function as Part 1.

### Task 5: manual-calibration.js

In this program, we manually calibrated the sensor. The sensor's data was mapped on a 5x5 graph on the microbit's LED matrix. The graph displayed rows of LEDs depending on how high the sensor's reading was.

### Task 6: auto-calibration.js

This program is basically the same as the one in Task 5 but with one added feature: the sensor was automatically calibrated.
